sorry i didn't put comments, i haven't tried doing any programming thing with anyone and i'm sort of sick of doing it for
a class i'm doing.
correct alignment moves the player to the right place when switching between rooms, sorta works well enough.
left is jump.
right is shrink.
down is move left.
up is move right.

the bugged out room is if you glitch out of the game because of how badly the correct alignment thing is done.
