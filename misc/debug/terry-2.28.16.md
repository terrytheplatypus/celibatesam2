another one for good measure http://imgur.com/ufFHMUu<br>
also, the reset button freezes it<br>
now the linking stopped working :P<br>
actually never mind, that still works<br>
i realized if i move the scrolling button on the mouse, that zooms in and out your part, though it still shows no text<br>
there's a black screen for 10 seconds before your part shows up<br>
actually, i have to go to a different tab first before it shows up<br>

i did figure out how to get past part 2 and get to nuuup's part, but the part after that played the music, but after the loading bar, it just showed a black screen<br>
does it work for you if you try the gamejolt page?<br>
also, is the idea to complete your part to glitch-jump up the left wall?<br>
the error it gives with the 4th part is "WebGL context lost. You need to reload the page, or failing that, restart the browser."<br>
sorry to dump all these bugs on you<br>
i realized that part was with vertex meadow, and i just tried other vertex meadow games and none of them work O.o<br>
weirdly enough, vertex meadow games work for me on internet explorer and not on chrome, but the actual celibate sam game doesn't work at all on internet explorer<br>
maybe i have a virus or some weird problem, i dunno<br>
also, one designy thing with part 2, it wouldn't be terrible to start people at the beginning after losing because it's not huge, but it would be good to have checkpoints so they don't have to go all the way back<br>
i feel like someone who would actually want to play this wouldn't care, though<br>
