@muclorty hi, do you maybe know why i'd be getting this error with all Amulet games in chrome on windows 8? http://pastebin.com/xUxeri6Q

@terrytheplatypu Do other webgl pages work? e.g. https://www.shadertoy.com/

@muclorty shadertoy works, but it makes my fan get noticeably louder when i click on one of them (though not super-loud)

@terrytheplatypu hmm, ok, does this one work: http://www.amulet.xyz/player.html?gist=c5f70cc0486bfb14b1f7

@muclorty except now that i tried it again, it stopped working :P
maybe i have some virus targeting chrome because it works fine on IE
 Ian MacLarty ‏@muclorty  9h9 hours ago
@terrytheplatypu do you have a lot of other tabs open? it could just be not enough video memory maybe?

@muclorty i closed everything else, and it works fine on IE, so i think maybe it's a virus,

@muclorty thanks for trying to help
 Ian MacLarty ‏@muclorty  9h9 hours ago
@terrytheplatypu not sure if it’s a virus, but it does seem like something to do with chrome and webgl. Is it latest chrome?

@muclorty yeah, that's what it says
